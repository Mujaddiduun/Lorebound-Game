Build a 2D story-driven exploration game called "Lorebound" that deeply integrates Honeycomb Protocol to power:

On-chain missions and quest tracking.
Player trait evolution.
XP and progression systems.
Replayable branching paths.
Lore collectible NFTs (optional).

This project should result in a fully functional MVP deployable on Solana Devnet, complete with wallet authentication, basic game logic, and on-chain progression tracked via Honeycomb.

Game Narrative Concept
Players explore zones in a mystical world, uncovering lore by completing on-chain quests. Each action evolves their on-chain identity, stored as traits. These traits impact what content they unlock, creating permanent, composable profiles tied to player choices.

üîß Project Requirements

Must-Have Features

- Your submission must include a game concept or playable MVP that uses the Honeycomb - Protocol
- The game must include at least one of the following mechanics powered by Honeycomb:

Missions or quests

- Trait assignment or evolution
- On-chain progression or experience systems
- Code must be public on GitHub, with a README 
- Submission must include a basic working prototype (devnet or Mainnet).
- Explanation of how Honeycomb powers your game logic

Judging Criteria

- Use of Honeycomb in a meaningful way (missions, traits, progression logic)
- Creative game design and original concept
- Code clarity, modularity, and documentation
- Replayability, progression depth, or community mechanics
- Integration with other Solana tools (Verxio, Metaplex, etc.)

Responsive and mobile-friendly interface

 Architecture Plan

Frontend (React  + Typescript + Three.js + Tailwind)
- Game Scene (canvas-based map/zone)
- Quest Panel (current mission, objectives)
- Profile Panel (traits, XP, completed quests)
- Modal system for interactions and choices
- Smart Contracts (Anchor)
- trait mutation rules
- NFT minting logic
- Game-specific reward or reputation modules
- Honeycomb Integration

Use Honeycomb SDK to:

- Create & retrieve missions
- Assign/retrieve traits
- Add XP per player action
- Track mission status

 Key Components

‚úÖ Missions via Honeycomb

- Create 3-5 mission schemas using Honeycomb's mission template
- Set XP + trait rewards upon completion

Example mission:

- ID: zone_forest_discovery
- Name: "Discover the Hidden Grove"
- Rewards: +10 XP, trait: Explorer

‚úÖ Traits via Honeycomb

Define traits:

- Scholar, Fighter, Explorer, Trickster
- Use Honeycomb trait assignment logic
- Traits affect available missions (branching logic)

‚úÖ XP/Level System

- Add XP per mission using Honeycomb
- Define levels based on XP thresholds
- Display progression bar in UI

‚úÖ Optional: Lore NFTs

- After completing key quests, mint NFT (IPFS image + lore text)
- Use Metaplex or custom Anchor contract

üîÅ Game Flow Example

- Player connects wallet
- Sees current unlocked zone (e.g., Forest of Echoes)
- Clicks ‚ÄúStart Quest‚Äù ‚Üí sees mission panel
- Interacts with puzzle or mini objective

Upon success:

- Honeycomb marks mission complete
- XP increases, new trait assigned
- New zone unlocked based on trait
- Player views traits and scrolls in profile

üîé Submission Checklist
- Use of Honeycomb in a meaningful way (missions, traits, progression logic)
- Creative game design and original concept
- Code clarity, modularity, and documentation
- Replayability, progression depth, or community mechanics
- Integration with other Solana tools (Verxio, Metaplex, etc.)

‚ú® Bonus Uniqueness Enhancers
